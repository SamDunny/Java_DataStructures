Triangles! Oh Fractals!

Due 10/23/2020 at 11:55PM

 

Objective: 

Write a program in which it draws a triangular fractal using recursion, and Java Swing. 

 

Suggested Methodology

The idea for it is this

First draw a filled equilateral triangle
Next draw another filled equilateral triangle of a different color thatâ€™s upside down in the middle of that triangle
Using the other triangles formed repeat step 2 until a pixel limit of 4 is reached
 



HINTS: 

JFrame and Canvas are two types that may help.
The method fillPolygon(int[] xPoints, int[] yPoint, numberOfPoints) as called by the graphics device is important
The method setColor(Color aColor) is important for picking different colors to draw things.
