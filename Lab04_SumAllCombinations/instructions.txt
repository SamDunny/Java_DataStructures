Sum All Combinations

 

Objective / Requirements:

 

Write a program that recursively prints the sum of all combinations of 5 randomly selected integers. Single values are also included in the print out. For example if the array had the following values {1,2,3,4,5}, then the it will print:

 

1 = 1

1 + 2 = 3

1 + 2 + 3 = 6

1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10

1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15

1 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 11

1 + 2 + 4 = 7

1 + 2 + 4 + 5 = 12

1 + 2 + 5 = 8

1 + 3 = 4

1 + 3 + 4 = 8

1 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 13

1 + 3 + 5 = 9

1 + 4 = 5

1 + 4 + 5 = 10

1 + 5 = 6

2 = 2

2 + 3 = 5

2 + 3 + 4 = 9

2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 14

2 + 3 + 5 = 10

2 + 4 = 6

2 + 4 + 5 = 11

2 + 5 = 7

3 = 3

3 + 4 = 7

3 + 4 + 5 = 12

3 + 5 = 8

4 = 4

4 + 5 = 9

5 = 5

 

 

Hints:

Recursive methods generally attempt to solve a smaller problem then return the results of those in order to solve the larger one.
Using an additional array to keep track of the current combination may help
Backtracking by using the stack property of recursion will help greatly.

Welcome to the sum of all combinations program!

Given array = {15 50 74 88 91}, all summed combinations are:

15 = 15

15 + 50 = 65

15 + 50 + 74 = 139

15 + 50 + 74 + 88 = 227

15 + 50 + 74 + 88 + 91 = 318

15 + 50 + 74 + 91 = 230

15 + 50 + 88 = 153

15 + 50 + 88 + 91 = 244

15 + 50 + 91 = 156

15 + 74 = 89

15 + 74 + 88 = 177

15 + 74 + 88 + 91 = 268

15 + 74 + 91 = 180

15 + 88 = 103

15 + 88 + 91 = 194

15 + 91 = 106

50 = 50

50 + 74 = 124

50 + 74 + 88 = 212

50 + 74 + 88 + 91 = 303

50 + 74 + 91 = 215

50 + 88 = 138

50 + 88 + 91 = 229

50 + 91 = 141

74 = 74

74 + 88 = 162

74 + 88 + 91 = 253

74 + 91 = 165

88 = 88

88 + 91 = 179

91 = 91
