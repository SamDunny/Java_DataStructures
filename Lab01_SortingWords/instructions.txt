Lab 01

Sorting Various Words by Various Properties

 

Objective:

 

Write a program that analyzes a collection of words and sorts them in ascending order by the number of vowels, consonants, and the length of the word.

 

Requirements:

 

First download the driver file and the text file and include it in your project

 

Next write a class called WordHelper and implement the following methods

sortByVowels: This static method returns a sorted String array, takes in an array of Strings via a parameter, and sorts them from smallest to largest by the number of vowels.
sortByConsonants: This static method returns a sorted String array, takes in an array of Strings via a parameter, and sorts them from smallest to largest by the number of consonants.
sortByLength: This method static returns a sorted String array, takes in an array of Strings via a parameter, and sorts them from smallest to largest by the number of letters.
 

You may

Write additional methods and classes to best complete this project
Assume that only alphabetic characters are in the words
Assume that “Y” counts as a vowel
Write any kind of sorting algorithm
Assume that in the event of ties that any arbitrary word is picked.
The only characters are A-Z. No numeric or special characters.
 

You may NOT

Use any built in sorting methods (such as Arrays.sort())
Assume that it is not case sensitive, so “A” and “a” are considered the same character.
