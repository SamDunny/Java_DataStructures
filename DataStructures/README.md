**Linked Lists**: a list of 'nodes' that are either singly-linked or doubly linked  
1. Singly linked: contains only one link between nodes  
1. Doubly linked: contains a forward and backwards link between nodes    

**Queues**: a FIFO (first in, first out) data structure which can be implemented in various ways  
1. Linked list queue: a queue that uses a linked list orginization (eg. head, tail)  
1. Array queue: a queue that uses a rigid array structure, as well as circular indexing (using %)    

**Stacks**: a LIFO (last in, first out) data structure that can be implemented in various ways  
1. Linked list stack: a stack that uses a linked list orginization (only needs head for operations)  
1. Array stack: a stack that uses a rigid array structure, with regular array indexing  

**Binary Search Trees**: a data structure organized into a parent node and two child nodes (left children < parent) (right children > parent)  
1. Linked binary search tree: uses nodes, contains add, printPreOrder, printInOrder, printPostOrder, search, and remove methods
