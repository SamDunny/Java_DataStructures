Objective:

 

Write a program that manages a Movie Database. The user should be able to add, remove, and search the database. Along with being able to print and read from a database file.

 

Requirements:

Make a class GenLL which has the following:
An internal class of list nodes that hold a generic type and link
A head node for the start of the list
A current which iterates through the list
A previous node which is always one behind the current.
Functionality that
Adds a new item of a generic type
Remove a given item from the list (via parameter)
Return true or false if a given item (via parameter) is found in the list.
Returns the value of where the current iterator is located. If the iterator is at the end of the list it should return null.
Move the current iterator forward
Move the iterator to the head node
Remove an item at the iterator’s current position
Prints the list to the console
Make a class MovieDatabase which will have a generic linked list (GenLL) of Strings (representing the movie’s title) and the following functionality
Add a Movie
Remove a movie by Title
Search the movie by Title. Returns true if it is found.
Print out all the movies to the console
Make a class MovieDatabaseFrontEnd which is front end that will allow a user to use any of the features noted in the database description. For instance, it may look like:
Enter 1: to Add a Movie
Enter 2: to Remove a Movie by Title
Enter 3: to Search for Movies by Title
Enter 4: to Print All Movies
Enter 9: to Quit
Other notes
You MAY NOT use any built-in java linked structures, such as LinkedList, ArrayList, etc. The point of this is to implement these structures and use them.
If you want a CHALLENGE try to print the information to a file and also read it back in!
